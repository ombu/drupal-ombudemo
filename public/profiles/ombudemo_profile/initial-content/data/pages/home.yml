          <p class="lead">Take a ride down the blue waters of the Willamette and
          you’ll pass under our legacy: a suite of indelible bridges which have
          given Portland as much of its identity as has roses, coffee, and
          independent bookstores.  Our bridges have brought people together for
          over a century, and that spirit continues to drive us today.</p>

              <p>A bridge will stand for centuries, outliving the architectural
              trends and cultural fads that come and go around it.  Our master
              designers understand this; they reach for the future while
              cherishing the past.</p>

              <p>Through earthquakes and floods, hurricanes and heat waves, our
              bridges stand proudly.  Our rigorous construction processes ensure
              longetivy for the final structure and safety for all of its
              passengers.</p>

              <p>Our bridges were once traveled by horse and buggy.  Now they
              are traveled by bicycle and light rail.  Soon, we can expect
              jetpacks and other modes of which we haven’t dreamt — but will
              accommodate!</p>

          <p>Our bridges are carefully designed to withstand wind gusts of up to
          80 MPH and earthquakes registering 7.9 on the Richter scale. Our
          elegant passive damper technology counteracts all naturally occurring
          forces, maintaining stability in unpredictable conditions.</p>
